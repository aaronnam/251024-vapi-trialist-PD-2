## Integration with Permanent Documentation

When your work is complete:

1. **Move summary to permanent docs**
   - Implementation guides → `docs/implementation/features/`
   - Risk analysis → `docs/security/`
   - Research findings → `docs/research/`

2. **Archive in completed-tasks/**
   - Keep for historical reference
   - Date stamp for easy lookup
   - Reference from permanent docs if needed

3. **Update main README**
   - Link to new permanent documentation
   - Remove from temporary task list

## This Directory in Git

### Option A: Include in Git (Recommended)
```bash
# Track everything - creates historical record
# Archive old completed tasks monthly
```
- **Pros**: Historical record, team visibility
- **Cons**: Repository grows with updates

### Option B: Exclude from Git
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo ".project-status/" >> .gitignore
```
- **Pros**: Clean repository
- **Cons**: Task history not preserved

### Option C: Hybrid (Best Balance)
```bash
# Track only high-level status and coordination
# Ignore ephemeral work documents
echo ".project-status/*.md" >> .gitignore
echo "!.project-status/NEXT_STEPS.md" >> .gitignore
echo "!.project-status/coordination/" >> .gitignore
```
