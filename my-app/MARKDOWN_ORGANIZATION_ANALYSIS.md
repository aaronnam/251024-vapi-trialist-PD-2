## Current State: What's in my-app/

### File Inventory

| File | Lines | Category | Purpose | Status |
|------|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | 5 | Redirect | Points to AGENTS.md | ✅ Keep |
| `GEMINI.md` | 5 | Redirect | Points to AGENTS.md | ✅ Keep |
| `README.md` | 141 | Core Guide | Project setup & overview | ✅ Keep |
| `AGENTS.md` | 211 | Core Guide | **PRIMARY** development guide | ✅ Keep |
| `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` | 144 | Operations | Pre-deployment verification | ✅ Keep/Move |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | 218 | Feature Docs | Error recovery implementation | ⚠️ Archive |
| `ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md` | 335 | Feature Docs | Error handling patterns | ✅ Keep/Move |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_DESIGN.md` | 617 | Feature Docs | Calendar integration design | ✅ Keep/Move |
| `TEST_FAILURE_REPORT.md` | 342 | Work Notes | Test failure analysis | ⚠️ Archive |
| `TEST_FAILURE_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md` | 466 | Work Notes | Deep dive on test issues | ⚠️ Archive |
| `TEST_RESULTS_AFTER_FIX.md` | 361 | Work Notes | Test results after fixes | ⚠️ Archive |

### Problem Areas Identified

#### 1. **Agent IDE Redirects** (Minor)
- `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are just 5-line redirects
- **Issue**: Unnecessary files; AGENTS.md should be the canonical location
- **Solution**: Keep them (they're harmless and follow agent IDE conventions)

#### 2. **Feature Docs Mixed in Root** (Moderate)
```
Root level:
├── ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md          (Feature-specific)
├── GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_DESIGN.md (Feature-specific)
├── IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md        (Feature-specific)
```

- **Issue**: Feature implementation docs scattered at root level
- **Impact**: Hard to find feature docs when working on new features
- **Solution**: Move to `docs/features/` subdirectory

#### 3. **Work-in-Progress Notes as Permanent Docs** (Major)
```
Root level:
├── TEST_FAILURE_REPORT.md           (WIP - Oct 27)
├── TEST_FAILURE_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md    (WIP - Oct 27)
├── TEST_RESULTS_AFTER_FIX.md        (WIP - Oct 27)
```

- **Issue**: Temporary debugging notes treated as permanent documentation
- **Impact**: Creates confusion about current state vs. history
- **Solution**: Archive to project-status, keep only if actively needed

#### 4. **Deployment Guide Unclear** (Minor)
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` is specific to LiveKit Cloud deployment
- **Solution**: Move to docs/implementation/deployment/ or integrate with README

#### 5. **No Feature Documentation Index** (Organization)
- New engineers can't easily find feature docs
- **Solution**: Create `FEATURES.md` index listing all implemented features

---

## Recommended Organization Structure

### Option A: Minimal Changes (Recommended)
Keep my-app/ lightweight, move feature docs to parent docs/:

```
my-app/
├── CLAUDE.md                        # Keep - Agent IDE convention
├── GEMINI.md                        # Keep - Agent IDE convention
├── README.md                        # Keep - Setup & overview
├── AGENTS.md                        # Keep - **PRIMARY development guide**
├── DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md          # Keep - Deployment reference
│
├── docs/                            # NEW - Feature docs
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── error-recovery/
│   │   │   └── GUIDE.md             (from ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md)
│   │   │
│   │   └── google-calendar-booking/
│   │       └── DESIGN.md            (from GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_DESIGN.md)
│   │
│   └── .archived/                   # NEW - Historical docs
│       ├── error-recovery-implementation-summary.md
│       ├── test-failure-report.md
│       ├── test-failure-deep-analysis.md
│       └── test-results-after-fix.md
│
├── src/
├── tests/
├── scripts/
└── ...
```

**Rationale**:
- Keep AGENTS.md as primary development guide
- Feature docs accessible within my-app/docs/
- Historical test notes archived but preserved
- Deployment checklist stays for quick reference

---

### Option B: Everything at Root (Current State)
Keep everything at root level as-is.

**Pros**: No reorganization effort
**Cons**: Harder to navigate, feature docs scattered, no clear distinction between permanent and temporary docs

---

### Option C: Mirror Root Structure
Create full directory structure matching parent docs/:

```
my-app/
├── README.md
├── AGENTS.md
├── docs/
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── error-recovery/
│   │   └── google-calendar-booking/
│   ├── deployment/
│   │   └── CHECKLIST.md
│   └── operations/
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

**Pros**: Consistent with root documentation structure
**Cons**: May be over-engineered for my-app/

---

## Detailed Analysis: File-by-File Recommendations

### 1. Core Development Guides (Keep at Root)

#### `AGENTS.md` (211 lines) - PRIMARY DEVELOPMENT GUIDE
- **Purpose**: Authoritative guide for working with LiveKit Agents
- **Content**: Project structure, testing, deployment, CLI usage
- **Status**: ✅ **KEEP - This is the canonical development guide**
- **Note**: This is referenced in parent CLAUDE.md and should remain primary

#### `README.md` (141 lines)
- **Purpose**: Project setup, dependencies, dev instructions
- **Content**: Installation, environment setup, running locally/in cloud
- **Status**: ✅ **KEEP - Standard project README**
- **Note**: Good reference alongside AGENTS.md

### 2. Agent IDE Redirects (Keep)

#### `CLAUDE.md` & `GEMINI.md` (5 lines each)
- **Purpose**: Redirect Claude/Gemini to AGENTS.md
- **Status**: ✅ **KEEP - Follows agent IDE conventions**
- **Why**: These are expected by Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI
- **Note**: Don't change; they're used by the IDEs

### 3. Operational/Deployment Guides (Organize)

#### `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (144 lines)
- **Purpose**: Pre-deployment verification for LiveKit Cloud
- **Content**: Secrets verification, code quality, deployment steps
- **Status**: ✅ **KEEP** (useful for developers deploying)
- **Option**: Keep at root OR move to `docs/deployment/CHECKLIST.md`
- **Recommendation**: **KEEP at root** - it's frequently referenced before deploying

### 4. Feature Implementation Docs (Move to docs/)

#### `ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md` (335 lines)
- **Purpose**: Document error recovery patterns and implementation
- **Content**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, error responses, configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Feature doc - should be with code
- **Recommendation**: **Move to `docs/features/error-recovery/GUIDE.md`**
- **Rationale**:
  - Feature-specific, not a general development guide
  - Keeps root clean
  - Easier to find when implementing error handling
  - Co-located with IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY if needed

#### `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_DESIGN.md` (617 lines)
- **Purpose**: Technical design for Google Calendar meeting booking
- **Content**: Requirements, architecture, implementation patterns, authentication
- **Status**: ✅ Feature doc - matches feature code
- **Recommendation**: **Move to `docs/features/google-calendar-booking/DESIGN.md`**
- **Rationale**:
  - Feature-specific design documentation
  - Long (617 lines) - benefits from dedicated directory
  - Easier to discover when working on booking feature
  - Can grow with future iterations

#### `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (218 lines)
- **Purpose**: Summary of error recovery implementation (incomplete - only covers error recovery)
- **Content**: What was implemented, key features, completed tasks
- **Status**: ⚠️ Feature-specific, appears to be work notes
- **Recommendation**: **Move to `docs/features/error-recovery/IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
- **Alternative**: Archive if superseded by ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md
- **Note**: Check if this is still actively used or historical

### 5. Work-in-Progress Debugging Notes (Archive)

#### `TEST_FAILURE_REPORT.md` (342 lines)
- **Purpose**: Analysis of test failures (dated Oct 27)
- **Content**: Failure categories, root cause analysis, specific test failures
- **Status**: ⚠️ Historical work notes (from debugging session)
- **Recommendation**: **Archive to `.archived/`**
- **Rationale**:
  - Dated (Oct 27 - potentially outdated)
  - Documents problems already fixed
  - Not a general development guide
  - Takes up root space without long-term value

#### `TEST_FAILURE_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md` (466 lines)
- **Purpose**: Deep dive on test failure root causes
- **Content**: Detailed analysis of tool discovery issues, LLM judge sensitivity, etc.
- **Status**: ⚠️ Historical work notes
- **Recommendation**: **Archive to `.archived/`**
- **Rationale**:
  - Very detailed debugging output
  - Specific to a point-in-time test run
  - If issues recur, can be useful reference
  - But shouldn't clutter root for daily development

#### `TEST_RESULTS_AFTER_FIX.md` (361 lines)
- **Purpose**: Test results after implementing fixes
- **Content**: Test pass/fail summary, improvements made
- **Status**: ⚠️ Historical work notes
- **Recommendation**: **Archive to `.archived/`**
- **Rationale**:
  - Shows progress on specific date
  - May be outdated by now
  - Not actionable for future engineers
  - Preserved for historical record if needed

## Proposed Organization Plan

### Phase 1: Create Directory Structure (5 minutes)
```bash
mkdir -p my-app/docs/features/error-recovery
mkdir -p my-app/docs/features/google-calendar-booking
mkdir -p my-app/docs/.archived
```

### Phase 2: Move Feature Docs (10 minutes)
```bash
# Move feature documentation
mv ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md docs/features/error-recovery/GUIDE.md
mv GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_DESIGN.md docs/features/google-calendar-booking/DESIGN.md

# Move implementation summary (if keeping)
mv IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md docs/features/error-recovery/IMPLEMENTATION.md

# Archive historical debugging notes
mv TEST_FAILURE_REPORT.md docs/.archived/
mv TEST_FAILURE_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md docs/.archived/
mv TEST_RESULTS_AFTER_FIX.md docs/.archived/
```

### Phase 3: Create Navigation READMEs (10 minutes)
```
docs/
├── README.md                        # NEW - Features overview
├── features/
│   ├── README.md                    # NEW - Feature index
│   ├── error-recovery/
│   │   └── README.md                # NEW - Error recovery overview
│   │
│   └── google-calendar-booking/
│       └── README.md                # NEW - Booking feature overview
│
└── .archived/
    └── README.md                    # NEW - Archive explanation
```

### Phase 4: Update References (5 minutes)
- Update AGENTS.md to reference feature docs in docs/features/
- Update README.md if it references moved files
- No changes needed to CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md

## Benefits of This Organization

| Benefit | Current | After |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Root clarity** | 11 files (mixed purposes) | 4 essential files (dev guides + deployment) |
| **Feature discoverability** | Scattered at root | `docs/features/` organized |
| **New engineer onboarding** | Confusing structure | Clear: AGENTS.md → docs/features/ |
| **Work-in-progress clutter** | Mixed with permanent docs | Separated to `.archived/` |
| **Growth scalability** | Hard to add new features | Clear pattern to follow |
| **Long-term maintainability** | Accumulating files | Organized by feature + archive |

---

## Size Comparison

### Before
```
my-app/ (root level)
├── Core guides: 357 lines
├── Feature docs: 1,170 lines  ← Feature docs at root!
├── Work notes: 1,169 lines    ← Historical debugging cluttering root!
├── Redirects: 10 lines
└── Deployment: 144 lines
```

### After
```
my-app/ (root level)
├── Core guides: 357 lines     (AGENTS.md, README.md)
├── Deployment: 144 lines      (DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
├── Redirects: 10 lines        (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md)

my-app/docs/features/
├── Feature docs: 1,170 lines  (organized by feature)

my-app/docs/.archived/
└── Work notes: 1,169 lines    (preserved but not in root)
```

**Result**: Root reduced by ~60% in size/clutter while preserving all content

---

## Implementation Recommendations

### DO THIS FIRST
1. ✅ Keep `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` at root (they're essential)
2. ✅ Keep `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` (agent IDE convention)
3. ✅ Keep `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (referenced frequently)

### DO NEXT (When ready)
1. Create `docs/features/` directory structure
2. Move feature-specific guides to feature directories
3. Create navigation READMEs for new subdirectories
4. Update AGENTS.md with reference to feature docs location

### CONSIDER ARCHIVING (Lower priority)
- Move test failure notes to `.archived/` to clean up root
- These are preserved if needed for historical reference

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Are the test failure notes still needed?**
   - If tests are fixed, archive them
   - If tests are ongoing issues, keep them but in `.archived/`

2. **Is IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY still used?**
   - If it's just a summary of error recovery implementation, move it to the error-recovery feature directory
   - If it documents completed work, consider archiving

3. **Should feature docs stay with code or in parent docs/?**
   - **Recommendation**: Keep in `my-app/docs/features/` so they're close to the code
   - Engineers working on error recovery find guide right there

---

## Success Criteria

After implementation:
- ✅ Root `my-app/` has only 4-5 essential markdown files
- ✅ Feature docs organized in `docs/features/` by feature name
- ✅ Historical/work notes archived in `docs/.archived/`
- ✅ New engineers can find feature docs easily
- ✅ AGENTS.md remains the primary development guide
- ✅ Each feature directory has README explaining its purpose

---

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Execute Phase 1-3**: Create directories, move files, create navigation READMEs?
2. **Just Phase 1-2**: Move files without creating full navigation structure?
3. **Just archive**: Archive the test failure notes to reduce root clutter?
4. **Wait and review**: First review this plan before executing?
