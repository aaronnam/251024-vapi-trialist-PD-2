# Langfuse TTS/STT Observability - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented minimal, safe additions to enable TTS/STT model visibility in Langfuse Model Usage dashboard.

## Changes Made

### Location
`/my-app/src/agent.py` - Lines 1449-1452, 1504-1508, 1543-1546

### What Was Added

Added OpenTelemetry standard attributes (`gen_ai.*`) to existing span enrichment logic for all three model types:

#### 1. LLM Metrics (Lines 1449-1452)
```python
# OpenTelemetry standard attributes for Model Usage visibility
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.request.model", "gpt-4.1-mini")
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.input_tokens", ev.metrics.prompt_tokens)
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.output_tokens", ev.metrics.completion_tokens)
```

#### 2. STT Metrics (Lines 1504-1508)
```python
# OpenTelemetry standard attributes for Model Usage visibility
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.request.model", "deepgram-nova-2")
# Normalize seconds to pseudo-tokens (1 second = 100 tokens for consistency)
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.input_tokens", int(stt_seconds * 100))
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.output_tokens", 0)  # STT has no output tokens
```

#### 3. TTS Metrics (Lines 1543-1546)
```python
# OpenTelemetry standard attributes for Model Usage visibility
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.request.model", "Cartesia-3")
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.input_tokens", ev.metrics.characters_count)
current_span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.output_tokens", 0)  # TTS has no output tokens
```

## Safety Features

✅ **No structural changes** - All existing code remains intact
✅ **Only additions** - New attributes added alongside existing ones
✅ **Error-protected** - All additions within existing try/except blocks
✅ **Non-breaking** - Agent continues working even if attributes fail to set
✅ **Syntax validated** - Python import check passed successfully

## What This Enables

These standard OpenTelemetry attributes will allow Langfuse Model Usage dashboard to recognize and track:

- **Cartesia-3** (TTS) - Character usage and costs
- **deepgram-nova-2** (STT) - Audio duration (normalized to tokens) and costs
- **gpt-4.1-mini** (LLM) - Token usage and costs (already working, now enhanced)

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally (Recommended First)
```bash
cd /Users/aaron.nam/Desktop/Repos/251024-vapi-trialist-PD-2/my-app
uv run python src/agent.py console
# Speak a few sentences and verify no errors in logs
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
lk agent deploy
# Wait for build to complete
lk agent restart
```

### 3. Verify in Langfuse (Wait 2-5 Minutes After Test Session)
1. Navigate to Langfuse → Model Usage dashboard
2. Look for:
   - **Cartesia-3** with character counts and costs
   - **deepgram-nova-2** with audio duration (in pseudo-tokens) and costs
   - **gpt-4.1-mini** with token usage and costs

### 4. Check Langfuse Model Registry (If Models Don't Appear)
If models still don't appear after 5 minutes:

1. Go to Langfuse Settings → Models
2. Verify these models exist:
   - **Cartesia-3**: Unit=CHARACTERS, Input Price=0.00000006
   - **deepgram-nova-2**: Unit=TOKENS (normalized), Input Price=0.00000072 per token
   - **gpt-4.1-mini**: Should be auto-registered by Langfuse

3. If missing, add them manually with the pricing above

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If any issues arise, simply remove the new attributes by editing agent.py:

```bash
# Remove lines 1449-1452 (LLM gen_ai attributes)
# Remove lines 1504-1508 (STT gen_ai attributes)
# Remove lines 1543-1546 (TTS gen_ai attributes)

# Then redeploy
lk agent deploy && lk agent restart
```

All other functionality will continue working as before.

## Expected Behavior

### Console Mode
You should see normal debug messages like:
```
✅ Enriched LLM span with cost: $0.000123 (prompt: 42, completion: 58)
✅ Enriched STT span with cost: $0.000012 (3.45 seconds, 0.06 minutes)
✅ Enriched TTS span with cost: $0.000008 (123 chars)
```

No new log messages will appear - the implementation is transparent.

### Production Logs
Same as console mode - no changes to visible logging.

### Langfuse Dashboard
Within 2-5 minutes of a test session, you should see:
- Three models listed in Model Usage
- Cost graphs for each model
- Token/character/audio duration usage graphs

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Code changes implemented
- [x] Syntax validation passed
- [ ] Tested in console mode (recommended)
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Verified in Langfuse Model Usage dashboard
- [ ] Confirmed no errors in production logs

## Technical Details

### Why These Attributes?

Langfuse Model Usage specifically looks for the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for generative AI:
- `gen_ai.request.model` - Identifies which model was used
- `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` - Input usage (tokens, characters, or normalized)
- `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` - Output usage (0 for STT/TTS)

### STT Normalization Explained

Deepgram pricing is per minute, but Langfuse expects token-like units. We normalize:
- 1 second = 100 pseudo-tokens
- This allows consistent tracking in Langfuse's token-based UI
- Actual cost calculation remains unchanged (still uses seconds → minutes → cost)

### Why Output Tokens = 0?

For audio models:
- **STT**: Takes audio (input), produces text. We only track audio duration as input.
- **TTS**: Takes text (input), produces audio. We only track characters as input.
- Output tokens would represent the text/audio produced, which we're not tracking separately.

This is different from LLM where both prompt (input) and completion (output) tokens are tracked.

## Files Modified

- `/my-app/src/agent.py` - Added gen_ai.* attributes to metrics handler

## Files Created

- `/my-app/docs/LANGFUSE_TTS_STT_COST_FIX_CORRECTED.md` - Original comprehensive guide
- `/my-app/docs/LANGFUSE_TTS_STT_OBSERVABILITY_SOLUTION.md` - Research-based solution
- `/my-app/docs/LANGFUSE_SAFE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Safety review and implementation guide

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check agent logs: `lk agent logs | grep -E "Enriched|span"`
2. Verify Langfuse connection: Look for traces appearing in Langfuse UI
3. Check model registry: Ensure custom models are registered
4. Review error logs: `lk agent logs | grep -i error`

## Conclusion

Implementation complete and ready for testing. The changes are minimal, safe, and fully aligned with LiveKit's SDK patterns and OpenTelemetry standards.
