# Calendar Booking Tool - Testing Summary

## Executive Summary

The calendar booking tool test suite is **ready for use**. The optimal testing approach combines fast unit tests with selective integration tests and manual validation.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the recommended test suite
uv run pytest tests/test_calendar_tool_focused.py -v

# Expected: 9 passed, 1 skipped in ~13 seconds
```

## Test Coverage

### ✅ What's Tested (Automated)

1. **Qualification Logic** (Unit Tests - Fast & Deterministic)
   - Team size ≥ 5 → qualifies ✅
   - Volume ≥ 100 docs/month → qualifies ✅
   - Salesforce integration → qualifies ✅
   - HubSpot integration → qualifies ✅
   - API/embedded needs → qualifies ✅
   - Combined signals → qualifies correctly ✅
   - Below thresholds → does NOT qualify ✅

2. **Date/Time Handling** (Unit Tests)
   - Natural language parsing ("tomorrow at 2pm") ✅
   - Weekend dates moved to Monday ✅
   - Default to next business day 10am ✅

3. **Error Handling** (Integration Tests)
   - Calendar API failures → email fallback ✅
   - Unqualified user requests → self-serve guidance ✅
   - Tool validation → rejects unqualified users ✅

### ⏭️ What's NOT Tested (Automated)

1. **Tool Invocation Timing**
   - When exactly the LLM calls `book_sales_meeting`
   - Multi-turn conversation patterns before booking
   - **Why skipped:** LLM behavior is non-deterministic

2. **Signal Detection from Conversation**
   - How `_detect_signals()` extracts qualification data
   - **Why skipped:** Requires conversational context

**Solution:** Use manual console testing for these scenarios (see guide below)

## File Organization

```
tests/
├── CALENDAR_TOOL_TEST_GUIDE.md          # Comprehensive guide (this is your main reference)
├── test_calendar_tool_focused.py        # ✅ RECOMMENDED test suite
├── test_calendar_booking_tool.py        # ⚠️  Legacy tests (many failing due to consent flow)
└── CALENDAR_TESTING_SUMMARY.md          # This file
```

## Recommended Testing Workflow

### 1. Automated Testing (Before Commits)

```bash
# Run focused test suite
uv run pytest tests/test_calendar_tool_focused.py -v

# Should see: 9 passed, 1 skipped
```

**What this validates:**
- Qualification logic is correct
- Date/time parsing works
- Error handling is graceful
- Unqualified users don't get booking offers

### 2. Manual Console Testing (Before Deployment)

```bash
# Start agent in console mode
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

**Test Case 1: Qualified User (Should Book)**
```
User: Hi
Agent: [asks for consent]
User: Yes, that's fine
Agent: [offers help]
User: We have 10 sales reps on our team using Salesforce
Agent: [acknowledges]
User: I'm John Smith. Can we book a meeting for tomorrow at 2pm?
Agent: [should attempt booking or confirm details]
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Agent recognizes qualification (team size + Salesforce)
- ✅ Agent attempts to book meeting
- ✅ Booking confirmation provided

**Test Case 2: Unqualified User (Should NOT Book)**
```
User: Hi
Agent: [asks for consent]
User: Yes
Agent: [offers help]
User: I'm a solo freelancer sending about 5 proposals a month
Agent: [acknowledges]
User: Can I talk to someone about template creation?
Agent: [provides guidance, searches knowledge base]
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Agent provides helpful self-serve guidance
- ❌ NO offer to "talk to sales" or "book a call"
- ✅ Knowledge base search used for questions

### 3. Production Monitoring (After Deployment)

```bash
# Monitor tool usage
lk agent logs | grep "book_sales_meeting"

# Check qualification decisions
lk agent logs | grep "should_route_to_sales"

# Watch for errors
lk agent logs | grep -i "calendar.*error"
```

## Key Success Metrics

### Automated Tests
- ✅ 100% of unit tests passing (qualification logic)
- ✅ 100% of integration tests passing (error handling)
- ⏭️  1 test intentionally skipped (LLM non-determinism)

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Qualified users can successfully book meetings
- ✅ Unqualified users receive self-serve guidance
- ✅ Error cases provide email fallback
- ✅ Date/time preferences respected

### Production Metrics
- **Tool call rate:** % of sessions with booking attempts
- **Qualification accuracy:** Right users routed to sales
- **Error rate:** < 5% calendar API failures
- **User satisfaction:** Post-call booking experience

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### ❌ "Tests are failing because agent asks questions first"
**Solution:** This is expected LLM behavior. The agent may ask clarifying questions even when all info is provided. Use unit tests to validate logic, not LLM behavior.

### ❌ "Tool not being called in tests"
**Solution:**
1. Check `discovered_signals` are set before test
2. Ensure prompt has explicit booking intent
3. Remember: consent flow happens first
4. Consider using manual testing for end-to-end validation

### ❌ "Tool called for unqualified user"
**Solution:**
1. Verify qualification thresholds in `should_route_to_sales()`
2. Check signal detection in `_detect_signals()`
3. Review agent instructions for booking triggers

### ❌ "Calendar API mock not working"
**Solution:** See `test_calendar_tool_focused.py` for correct mock pattern

## When to Update Tests

**Update unit tests when:**
- Qualification criteria change (team size, volume thresholds)
- New integration types added (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Date/time parsing logic changes

**Update integration tests when:**
- Error handling behavior changes
- Response patterns change (e.g., new fallback messaging)
- Tool validation logic changes

**Update manual test scripts when:**
- Agent instructions change significantly
- Conversation flow changes (e.g., consent protocol)
- New booking scenarios emerge from production
