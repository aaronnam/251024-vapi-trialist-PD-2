# Langfuse Integration Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all fixes made to ensure complete visibility of voice agent conversations in Langfuse traces.

## Problem Timeline

### Initial State
- ✅ User email appearing in Langfuse session metadata
- ❌ User speech showing as `Input: null` in `user_speaking` spans
- ❌ LLM conversation context showing as `Input: null` in `llm_node` spans

### After Fixes
- ✅ User email in session metadata
- ✅ User speech transcripts visible in `user_speaking` spans
- ✅ LLM conversation context visible in `llm_node` spans

## Fix #1: User Speech Transcript Enrichment

### Problem
The `user_speaking` spans showed `Input: null` instead of the actual user transcript.

### Root Cause
LiveKit creates `user_speaking` spans internally with only timing attributes (`start_time`, `end_time`). The transcript data is not automatically added to these spans.

### Solution
**File**: `src/agent.py` lines 1491-1535

Enriched the existing `_user_speaking_span` by accessing it directly and adding transcript attributes when the `user_input_transcribed` event fires:

```python
@session.on("user_input_transcribed")
def on_user_input_transcribed(ev):
    if transcript:
        # Access LiveKit's internal user_speaking span
        if hasattr(session, '_user_speaking_span') and session._user_speaking_span:
            user_span = session._user_speaking_span
            user_span.set_attribute("langfuse.input", transcript)
            user_span.set_attribute("user.transcript", transcript)
            user_span.set_attribute("user.transcript.is_final", is_final)
```

### Result
- User transcripts now appear in `user_speaking` spans
- Both partial and final transcripts are captured
- Double coverage via `conversation_item_added` events

### Deployment
- **Version**: v20251031053225
- **Status**: ✅ Working (verified in production)

## Fix #2: LLM Conversation Context Enrichment

### Problem
The `llm_node` spans showed `Input: null` instead of the conversation history sent to the LLM.

### Root Cause
LiveKit creates `llm_node` spans internally when LLM requests are made, but these spans only include timing and cost metrics. The actual conversation messages are not automatically captured.

### Solution
**File**: `src/agent.py`

Two-part solution:

#### Part A: Conversation Formatter (lines 1191-1259)
Created helper function to format `ChatContext` into readable conversation log:

```python
def format_conversation_history(chat_context) -> str:
    """
    Format ChatContext into readable conversation log.

    Returns:
        system: You are Sarah...

        user: Hello, I need help

        assistant: Hi! I'd be happy to help...
    """
```

#### Part B: Span Enrichment (lines 1465-1496)
Updated `metrics_collected` handler to enrich LLM spans when `LLMMetrics` are emitted:

```python
if isinstance(ev.metrics, LLMMetrics):
    # ... existing cost tracking ...

    # Enrich LLM span with conversation context
    conversation_input = format_conversation_history(session.history)
    current_span = otel_trace.get_current_span()

    if current_span and current_span.is_recording():
        current_span.set_attribute("langfuse.input", conversation_input)
        current_span.set_attribute("llm.messages.count", message_count)
        current_span.set_attribute("llm.prompt_tokens", ev.metrics.prompt_tokens)
```

### Result
- LLM spans now show full conversation history as input
- Includes message count and token metrics
- Readable format in Langfuse UI

### Deployment
- **Version**: v20251031055350
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed (ready for verification)

## Common Pattern: Span Enrichment Strategy

Both fixes follow the same pattern:

### The Pattern
1. **Identify the Problem**: LiveKit creates internal spans without critical attributes
2. **Find the Timing**: Determine when the span is active and accessible
3. **Access the Span**: Use OpenTelemetry to get the current active span
4. **Enrich with Attributes**: Add `langfuse.input` and other relevant attributes
5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Wrap in try-catch to prevent agent failures

### Why This Works
- OpenTelemetry spans are mutable and can be enriched after creation
- Langfuse recognizes specific attribute names (`langfuse.input`, `langfuse.output`, etc.)
- LiveKit's spans remain active long enough to be enriched by event handlers
- Error handling ensures enrichment failures don't break the agent

## Complete Langfuse Visibility

### Session-Level Metadata
✅ **Set via `set_tracer_provider()`**
- `langfuse.session.id` - Room name
- `langfuse.user.id` - User email
- `user.email` - User email
- `participant.identity` - Participant ID

### Span-Level Attributes

#### user_speaking spans
✅ **Enriched via `user_input_transcribed` event**
- `langfuse.input` - User's spoken transcript
- `user.transcript` - User's spoken transcript
- `user.transcript.is_final` - Boolean indicating final vs partial
- `user.language` - Speech language (if available)
- `start_time` - When user started speaking
- `end_time` - When user stopped speaking

#### llm_node spans
✅ **Enriched via `metrics_collected` event with LLMMetrics**
- `langfuse.input` - Full conversation history sent to LLM
- `llm.messages.count` - Number of messages in context
- `llm.prompt_tokens` - Input tokens used
- `llm.completion_tokens` - Output tokens used

#### conversation_item spans
✅ **Created via `conversation_item_added` event**
- `langfuse.input` - User message content (for user items)
- `langfuse.output` - Assistant message content (for assistant items)
- `conversation.role` - Message role (user/assistant)
- `conversation.content` - Message text
- `conversation.interrupted` - Whether message was interrupted

#### Cost tracking spans
✅ **Created by CostTracker utility**
- `llm_usage` - LLM costs and token counts
- `tts_usage` - TTS costs and character counts
- `conversation_turn` - Aggregated costs per turn

## Verification Checklist

### For Each Fix
- [ ] Create new session in Agent Playground
- [ ] Have a multi-turn conversation
- [ ] Check Langfuse dashboard for the session
- [ ] Verify spans show expected input/output
- [ ] Check that attributes are present and readable
- [ ] Test edge cases (long conversations, interruptions, etc.)

### Expected Langfuse Trace Structure
```
session (trace)
├── participant_identified
│   └── langfuse.user.id: user@example.com
├── user_speaking ✅ Input: "Hello, I need help"
├── llm_node ✅ Input: "system: You are Sarah...\n\nuser: Hello, I need help"
├── llm_usage (cost tracking)
├── conversation_item ✅ Input: "Hello, I need help" (user)
├── tts_usage (cost tracking)
├── user_speaking ✅ Input: "How do I integrate with Salesforce?"
├── llm_node ✅ Input: Full conversation including new user message
├── conversation_item ✅ Output: "To integrate..." (assistant)
└── conversation_turn (aggregated metrics)
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Spans still showing null
**Check**:
1. Are you looking at NEW sessions (created after deployment)?
2. What agent version is running? (`lk agent status`)
3. Any errors in logs? (`lk agent logs | grep -i "failed to enrich"`)

### Issue: Incomplete conversation history
**Check**:
1. Is the conversation very long (may be truncated)?
2. Check `llm.messages.count` attribute for actual message count
3. Review logs for formatting errors

### Issue: Missing attributes
**Check**:
1. Verify LiveKit SDK version (may have API changes)
2. Check if event handlers are registered correctly
3. Look for OpenTelemetry warnings in logs

## Key Learnings

### 1. LiveKit Span Creation
LiveKit creates many spans internally that are accessible but not fully populated. Understanding which spans exist and when they're created is critical for enrichment.

### 2. Event Timing
The timing of enrichment is critical. Events must fire while spans are still active and recording. `metrics_collected` and `user_input_transcribed` are perfect timing points.

### 3. Error Handling
Always wrap enrichment logic in try-catch blocks. Span enrichment is important for observability but should never break the core agent functionality.

### 4. Langfuse Conventions
Langfuse recognizes specific attribute names:
- `langfuse.input` - Displayed as "Input" in UI
- `langfuse.output` - Displayed as "Output" in UI
- `langfuse.user.id` - User identification
- `langfuse.session.id` - Session grouping
- `langfuse.cost.total` - Cost display
- `langfuse.usage.*` - Token/usage metrics

### 5. Testing Strategy
Always test enrichment fixes in console mode first to catch initialization errors before deploying to production.

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **LLM Output Enrichment**: Capture the actual LLM response text, not just input
2. **Timestamp Attributes**: Add message-level timestamps
3. **Context Truncation**: Smart truncation for very long conversations
4. **Custom Formatters**: Configurable conversation formatting
5. **Span Hierarchy**: Better parent-child relationships between related spans

### Known Limitations
1. Only enriching after-the-fact (not before LLM calls)
2. Hardcoded conversation formatting
3. No automatic truncation for long contexts
4. LLM output not captured (only visible in conversation_item spans)
