# Deployment Verification - User Transcript Fix

## Deployment Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Deployment Details
- **Version**: v20251031053225
- **Deployed At**: 2025-10-31T05:33:30Z
- **Agent Status**: Running
- **Region**: us-east
- **Agent ID**: CA_9b4oemVRtDEm

### What Was Fixed
The user transcript showing as `null` in Langfuse traces has been fixed by:
1. Accessing LiveKit's internal `_user_speaking_span`
2. Enriching it with transcript data when received
3. Setting the critical `langfuse.input` attribute that Langfuse displays

### How to Verify the Fix Works

#### Step 1: Create a New Test Session
1. Open the Agent Playground: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/agents
2. Click "Create session"
3. Start a conversation with the agent
4. Say something like: "Hello, I need help with PandaDoc"
5. Let the agent respond
6. End the session after a few exchanges

#### Step 2: Check Langfuse Traces
1. Open your Langfuse dashboard
2. Look for the latest session (should match the room name from Agent Playground)
3. Find the `user_speaking` span(s)
4. **VERIFY**: The "Input" field should now show the actual user transcript
   - ✅ Expected: `Input: "Hello, I need help with PandaDoc"`
   - ❌ Old behavior: `Input: null`

#### Step 3: Verify All Attributes
In the `user_speaking` span details, you should see:
- `langfuse.input`: The user's transcript (critical for display)
- `user.transcript`: The same transcript text
- `user.transcript.is_final`: Boolean indicating if transcript is final
- `start_time`: When user started speaking
- `end_time`: When user stopped speaking

### Code Changes Applied
The fix was implemented in `agent.py` lines 1491-1521:

```python
@session.on("user_input_transcribed")
def on_user_input_transcribed(ev):
    if transcript:
        # Enrich LiveKit's internal user_speaking span
        if hasattr(session, '_user_speaking_span') and session._user_speaking_span:
            user_span = session._user_speaking_span
            user_span.set_attribute("langfuse.input", transcript)
            user_span.set_attribute("user.transcript", transcript)
            user_span.set_attribute("user.transcript.is_final", is_final)
```

### Fallback Coverage
The fix includes three levels of fallback to ensure transcripts are captured:
1. **Primary**: Enrich existing `_user_speaking_span`
2. **Secondary**: Enrich current active span if available
3. **Tertiary**: Create new `user_transcript` span if needed

Additionally, `conversation_item_added` events provide double coverage.

### Monitoring the Fix
To monitor that the fix continues working:

```bash
# Check for enrichment success messages
lk agent logs | grep "Enriched user_speaking span"

# Monitor user transcriptions
lk agent logs | grep "User said:"

# Check for any errors
lk agent logs | grep -i error | grep -i langfuse
```

### Expected Behavior
- User email: ✅ Visible at session level
- User transcript: ✅ Visible in `user_speaking` spans
- Assistant responses: ✅ Visible in `conversation_item` spans
- Session tracking: ✅ Room name as session ID

### Troubleshooting
If transcripts still show as `null`:
1. Ensure you're looking at NEW sessions (created after deployment)
2. Check that the agent version is v20251031053225 or later
3. Verify the agent was restarted after deployment
4. Check logs for any error messages

### Next Steps
1. Create a test session in Agent Playground
2. Verify transcripts appear in Langfuse
3. Monitor production conversations for consistency
4. Consider adding alerting for null transcripts

## Summary
The deployment is complete and the agent is running with the user transcript fix. The `user_speaking` spans in Langfuse should now properly display user input instead of `null`. Please test with a new session to verify the fix is working as expected.
