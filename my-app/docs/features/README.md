# Feature Implementation Guides

This directory contains implementation documentation for specific features of the PandaDoc Voice Agent.

Each feature has its own subdirectory with:
- `README.md` - Feature overview and quick start
- Implementation guides and technical documentation
- Design specifications and architecture notes

## Current Features

### [error-recovery/](./error-recovery/)
**Graceful error recovery and fault tolerance**

Comprehensive error recovery infrastructure ensuring the agent maintains natural conversation flow despite service failures.

**Key Components**:
- Circuit breaker pattern for cascading failure prevention
- Exponential backoff retry logic for transient errors
- Natural language error responses
- State preservation despite failures

**Files**:
- `GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide and implementation patterns
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation details and completion status

**When to use**: Building error handling into agent tools or understanding production error handling patterns

### [google-calendar-booking/](./google-calendar-booking/)
**Meeting booking integration with Google Calendar**

Voice-driven meeting booking for qualified trial users, seamlessly integrated with Google Calendar API.

**Key Features**:
- Qualification-driven booking (only for qualified leads)
- Direct calendar event creation
- Natural conversational booking experience
- Google Calendar API integration

**Files**:
- `DESIGN.md` - Technical design and architecture
- Implementation patterns and code examples

**When to use**: Working on meeting booking features or understanding calendar integration patterns

## Adding New Features

When implementing a new feature, follow this structure:

1. **Create a feature directory** under `features/` with a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens)
   ```bash
   mkdir features/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Create a README.md** with:
   - Feature overview (what does it do?)
   - Key components and architecture
   - Files in this directory and their purpose
   - "When to use" guidance

3. **Add implementation guides** as needed:
   - `GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step implementation
   - `DESIGN.md` - Technical architecture
   - Other supporting documentation

4. **Update this file** with the new feature description

## Feature Template

Use this template for new features:

```markdown
### [feature-name/](./feature-name/)
**Brief one-line description**

Longer description of what the feature does, what problems it solves, and when to use it.

**Key Components**:
- Component 1
- Component 2

**Files**:
- `README.md` - Feature overview
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - How to implement
- Other files

**When to use**: Context for when engineers would use this feature
```

## Feature Development Workflow

1. **Understand the feature** - Read the feature's README.md
2. **Review architecture** - Check DESIGN.md or GUIDE.md for patterns
3. **Follow examples** - Use code patterns documented in guides
4. **Test thoroughly** - Refer to [../AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for testing patterns
5. **Document changes** - Update feature docs if implementation differs
