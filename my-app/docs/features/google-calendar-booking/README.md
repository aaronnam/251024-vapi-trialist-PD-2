# Google Calendar Meeting Booking

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and production-ready
**Last Updated**: October 31, 2025
**Compatibility**: ✅ LiveKit Agents verified

## Overview

Voice-driven meeting booking integration that enables the PandaDoc Voice Agent to directly schedule sales meetings with qualified trial users. The system uses a priority chain to ensure reliable booking across different environments and configurations.

**Primary Booking Method**: Zapier webhook integration (recommended for corporate Google accounts)
**Fallback Methods**: Demo mode, then Google Calendar API

**Key Design Philosophy**:
- **Qualification-Driven**: Tool only activates for qualified leads (Tier 1: Sales-Ready)
- **Reliability First**: Multiple booking methods with automatic fallback
- **Voice-Optimized**: Fast execution with natural conversational flow
- **No Fallback Complexity**: Never offers human assistance (clear boundaries)
- **LiveKit Native**: Seamlessly integrated with LiveKit Agents framework

## Feature Overview

### What It Does
- Detects when qualified users want to schedule meetings
- Directly creates Google Calendar events
- Provides natural conversational confirmation
- Integrates user email with Salesforce for lead tracking

### When It Activates
- User is qualified (Tier 1: Sales-Ready)
- User explicitly requests a meeting
- Agent has calendar credentials configured

### What It Won't Do
- Offer to unqualified users
- Check complex availability
- Offer human handoff (clear business boundaries)
- Handle rescheduling (booking only)

## Architecture

### Booking Priority Chain

```
User Request
    ↓
Qualification Check
    ├─ Not Qualified? → Don't offer booking
    └─ Qualified? → Continue
    ↓
Meeting Intent Detection
    ├─ "Schedule a meeting" → Offer booking
    └─ Other intents → Don't offer
    ↓
Booking Method Selection (Priority Order)
    ├─ Priority 1: Zapier Webhook
    │   └─ If ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL configured
    │       ├─ Parse preferences (date/time)
    │       ├─ Send webhook payload to Zapier
    │       ├─ Zapier creates calendar event (OAuth)
    │       └─ Success: Return booking details
    │
    ├─ Priority 2: Demo Mode
    │   └─ If DEMO_MODE=true and Zapier unavailable
    │       ├─ Parse preferences (date/time)
    │       ├─ Generate Calendly link
    │       └─ Return demo booking details
    │
    └─ Priority 3: Google Calendar API (Fallback)
        └─ If neither Zapier nor Demo configured
            ├─ Authenticate with service account
            ├─ Parse preferences (date/time)
            ├─ Create calendar event via API
            └─ Return booking details
    ↓
Salesforce Integration (Optional)
    └─ Link meeting to lead record via email
```

### Method Details

**Zapier (Recommended for Production)**
- Uses OAuth authentication to your Google account
- No service account restrictions
- Works with corporate Google accounts
- Handles Google Meet link creation automatically
- Sends professional calendar invites

**Demo Mode (Development/Testing)**
- Returns a Calendly booking link
- No actual calendar event created
- Fast response, no external dependencies
- Perfect for testing qualification logic

**Google Calendar API (Legacy Fallback)**
- Direct API authentication via service account
- Creates actual calendar events
- Works in development environments
- May have restrictions on corporate accounts

### Configuration

**Primary Method: Zapier (Recommended)**

```bash
# .env.local
ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/YOUR_ID/YOUR_TOKEN/
```

Setup Instructions:
1. Create a Zap in Zapier (Webhooks by Zapier → Google Calendar)
2. Set trigger: "Catch Hook"
3. Set action: "Create Detailed Event" (Google Calendar)
4. Copy the webhook URL to ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL
5. Test with console mode

**Fallback Method: Google Calendar API**

```bash
# .env.local (already configured)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=/.secrets/pandadoc-voice-agent-03fa518aa3d0.json
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=c_f81fc95409534f4983a4bbb949b1ea35989199a5ae73d8383a9e022dea44b816@group.calendar.google.com
```

**Optional: Demo Mode**

```bash
# .env.local
DEMO_MODE=true  # Returns Calendly links instead of actual events
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Tool: `book_sales_meeting`

```python
@function_tool()
async def book_sales_meeting(
    self,
    context: RunContext,
    customer_name: str,
    customer_email: Optional[str] = None,
    preferred_date: Optional[str] = None,
    preferred_time: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Book a sales meeting for qualified users who explicitly request one.

    Uses priority chain:
    1. Zapier webhook (if ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL configured)
    2. Demo mode (if DEMO_MODE=true)
    3. Google Calendar API (fallback)

    Only available for qualified users (Tier 1: Sales-Ready).
    """
```

**Parameters**:
- `customer_name` - User's full name (REQUIRED)
- `customer_email` - User's email (optional, extracted from session if not provided)
- `preferred_date` - Natural language date like "tomorrow" or "next Tuesday"
- `preferred_time` - Natural language time like "2 PM" or "morning"

**Returns**: Dictionary with booking_status, meeting_time, and confirmation details

### How It Works

**Step 1: Booking Method Selection**
```python
if os.getenv("ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL"):
    return await self._book_via_zapier(...)
elif os.getenv("DEMO_MODE", "false").lower() == "true":
    return await self._book_via_demo(...)
else:
    return await self._book_via_google(...)
```

**Step 2: Zapier Integration (`_book_via_zapier` method)**
- Parses date/time into MM/DD/YYYY and HH:MM format
- Sends webhook payload to Zapier
- Zapier creates Google Calendar event with OAuth credentials
- Generates Google Meet link automatically
- Sends calendar invites to attendees
- Returns booking confirmation

**Step 3: Graceful Fallback**
- If Zapier fails → automatically tries Demo Mode
- If Demo fails → uses Google Calendar API
- If all fail → provides email fallback to sales team

### Key Features

1. **Natural Date/Time Parsing**
   - "Tomorrow at 2pm" → Next business day, 14:00
   - "Next Tuesday morning" → Parsed to business hours
   - Handles weekend detection automatically

2. **Email Extraction**
   - Automatically uses session email if available
   - No need to ask user twice for contact info
   - Used for calendar invites and Salesforce linking

3. **OAuth Authentication (Zapier)**
   - No service account restrictions
   - Works with corporate Google accounts
   - Zapier handles all OAuth edge cases
   - Professional calendar invites with Google Meet

4. **Conversation Flow**
   - Natural confirmation: "I'll send the invite to john@acme.com"
   - No technical jargon
   - Smooth integration into conversation
   - Professional meeting details included

## Integration with LiveKit

**Verified Compatibility**: ✅

The design uses standard LiveKit Agents patterns:
- `@function_tool` decorator (LiveKit standard)
- Async/await for external API calls
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Session context for user data
- Live testing with agent console

```python
# Example tool definition (LiveKit compatible)
@function_tool(
    description="Book a sales meeting with qualified users on Google Calendar"
)
async def book_sales_meeting(
    preferred_date: str = None,
    preferred_time: str = None
) -> str:
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Salesforce Integration

Meeting information can be synced to Salesforce for lead tracking:

- **Lead Lookup**: By email address (automatic)
- **Meeting Details**: Date, time, booking method
- **Session Context**: Stored with lead record
- **Attribution**: Tracks voice-initiated meetings

Implementation depends on your Salesforce schema and reporting needs. Contact your CRM administrator for integration details.

## Conversation Examples

### Qualified User (Booking Offered)
```
User: "I'm interested in discussing enterprise features"
Agent: [Qualification detected] "I'd be happy to help! Would you like to schedule
        a quick sales call to discuss your needs?"
User: "Sure, tomorrow at 2pm?"
Agent: "Perfect! I'll send the invite to john@acme.com for tomorrow at 2pm.
        You should see it in your inbox shortly."
User: "Great, thanks!"
```

### Unqualified User (No Offer)
```
User: "This looks interesting but I need to think about it"
Agent: [Not qualified yet] "No problem! Feel free to reach out if you have questions.
        Here are some resources in the meantime..."
```

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Verify Google service account credentials are loaded
- [ ] Test booking with qualified user in console mode
- [ ] Verify calendar invitations are sent correctly
- [ ] Check email addresses are captured correctly
- [ ] Test with date/time parsing edge cases
- [ ] Verify Salesforce integration is configured
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Load test with multiple concurrent bookings

## Testing

### Console Testing (Recommended)

```bash
# Start in console mode
cd my-app
uv run python src/agent.py console

# Test qualified user booking:
# "Hi, I'm John Smith from a 10-person team. Can we schedule a meeting tomorrow at 2pm?"

# Expected flow:
# 1. Agent detects qualification (10-person team)
# 2. Agent recognizes booking request
# 3. Agent calls book_sales_meeting()
# 4. Booking created via Zapier (or fallback method)
# 5. Confirmation: "I'll send the invite to john@example.com for tomorrow at 2pm"

# Verify in Google Calendar:
# - Event created with "PandaDoc Sales Consultation" title
# - Google Meet link included
# - Calendar invite sent to attendee email
```

### Testing Different Booking Methods

**Test Zapier (Primary)**
```bash
# Ensure Zapier is configured
export ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.zapier.com/..."
unset DEMO_MODE
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

**Test Demo Mode (Development)**
```bash
# Use demo mode for quick testing without webhooks
export DEMO_MODE=true
unset ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

**Test Google Calendar API (Fallback)**
```bash
# Test fallback method
unset ZAPIER_CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL
unset DEMO_MODE
uv run python src/agent.py console
```
