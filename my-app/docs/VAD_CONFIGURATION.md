# VAD Configuration for Silence Detection

## Problem Statement

Calls were not ending after the expected silence timeout period. Investigation revealed that VAD (Voice Activity Detection) was likely detecting background noise as speech, preventing users from ever reaching the "away" state.

## Root Cause

The agent was using default Silero VAD settings without explicit sensitivity tuning. Background noise (keyboard typing, room ambiance, mic feedback) was being detected as speech, preventing the `user_away_timeout` from triggering.

## Solution: Tuned VAD Sensitivity Parameters

Added production-optimized VAD parameters to `agent.py:1192-1196`:

```python
session = AgentSession(
    # ... other settings ...
    min_interruption_duration=0.6,      # Require 600ms speech (filters noise spikes)
    min_endpointing_delay=0.5,          # Wait 500ms after silence ends
    max_endpointing_delay=3.0,          # Force turn end after 3s
    false_interruption_timeout=2.0,     # 2s recovery for false triggers
    resume_false_interruption=True,     # Resume speech after false triggers
    user_away_timeout=30,               # Mark "away" after 30s silence
)
```

## What Changed

### Before (Implicit Defaults)
- `min_interruption_duration`: 0.5s (too sensitive - detects noise spikes)
- No false interruption recovery
- Background noise → detected as speech → never "away"

### After (Explicit Configuration)
- `min_interruption_duration`: **0.6s** (filters short noise bursts)
- `false_interruption_timeout`: **2.0s** (recovers from false triggers)
- `resume_false_interruption`: **True** (agent resumes after noise)

## Expected Behavior

### Silence Detection Flow
1. User stops speaking → VAD detects end of speech
2. After **30 seconds** of true silence → User marked as "away"
3. Agent says: *"Hello? Are you still there? I'll disconnect in a moment if I don't hear from you."*
4. Wait **10 more seconds** for response
5. If still "away" → Goodbye message and disconnect
6. **Total timeout: 40 seconds** (30s + 10s grace)

### Background Noise Handling
- Short noise bursts (<600ms) → **Ignored** by VAD
- Longer noise (>600ms) but non-speech → May trigger false interruption
- If false interruption → **2s timeout** → Agent resumes speaking
- True speech → Normal turn-taking

## Parameter Explanations

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `min_interruption_duration` | 0.6s | User must speak for 600ms to interrupt agent (filters keyboard clicks, coughs, ambient noise) |
| `min_endpointing_delay` | 0.5s | Wait 500ms after silence before considering turn ended (allows natural pauses like "um...") |
| `max_endpointing_delay` | 3.0s | Force turn end after 3s even if uncertain (prevents hanging) |
| `false_interruption_timeout` | 2.0s | If agent stops but no speech detected, wait 2s then resume (recovers from noise spikes) |
| `resume_false_interruption` | True | Agent resumes speaking after false interruption timeout |
| `user_away_timeout` | 30s | Mark user as "away" after 30s of true silence (triggers warning) |

## Tuning Philosophy

**Balanced for Enterprise Trial Calls:**
- **Not too sensitive**: Avoids false interruptions from background noise
- **Not too insensitive**: Detects user speech quickly for responsiveness
- **Cost-aware**: Disconnects after reasonable silence period (40s total)

## Testing & Validation

### Test Suite
Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_silence_detection.py`:
- ✅ 15 tests covering silence detection flow
- ✅ User state change handling
- ✅ Cost/time limits
- ✅ Analytics tracking
- ✅ Grace period behavior

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test in console mode: `uv run python src/agent.py console`
- [ ] Verify agent handles background noise (keyboard, ambient)
- [ ] Confirm silence detection triggers after 30s
- [ ] Check warning message plays correctly
- [ ] Validate disconnect after 40s total silence
- [ ] Test user can interrupt warning and continue

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Track
```python
# Add to production logging
@session.on("user_state_changed")
def log_state(ev):
    logger.info(f"User state: {ev.old_state} → {ev.new_state}")

# Monitor disconnect reasons
logger.info(f"Disconnect reason: {agent.session_data['disconnect_reason']}")
# Values: "silence_timeout", "time_limit", "cost_limit", "user_initiated"
```

### CloudWatch Queries
```
# Find sessions disconnected due to silence
fields @timestamp, session_id, disconnect_reason
| filter disconnect_reason = "silence_timeout"
| stats count() by bin(5m)

# Track user state transitions
fields @timestamp, session_id, user_state
| filter user_state = "away"
| stats count() as away_count by bin(1h)
```

## Future Tuning

If issues persist, consider:

### If Calls Still Don't End (VAD too sensitive)
```python
# Make LESS sensitive to noise
min_interruption_duration=0.8,  # Require 800ms speech
false_interruption_timeout=3.0,  # Longer recovery
```

### If Agent Misses User Speech (VAD too insensitive)
```python
# Make MORE sensitive to speech
min_interruption_duration=0.4,  # Detect shorter speech
min_endpointing_delay=0.3,      # Faster turn-taking
```

### If Too Aggressive on Disconnects
```python
# Wait longer before warning
user_away_timeout=45,  # 45s before "away" (vs 30s)
```
