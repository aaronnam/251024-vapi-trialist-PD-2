# my-app/ Markdown Organization - Quick Summary

## Current State
- **11 markdown files** at root level
- **2,845 total lines** of documentation
- Mix of core guides, feature docs, operational guides, and work-in-progress notes

## The Problem
1. Feature documentation scattered at root (ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md, GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_DESIGN.md)
2. Work-in-progress debugging notes treated as permanent documentation
3. Unclear structure for new engineers finding feature docs
4. No clear distinction between "must read" and "historical notes"

## The Solution (Option A: Recommended)

### Keep at Root (4 files)
- ✅ `AGENTS.md` - **PRIMARY development guide** (211 lines)
- ✅ `README.md` - Project setup & overview (141 lines)
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-deployment verification (144 lines)
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` & `GEMINI.md` - Agent IDE redirects (5 lines each)

### Move to `docs/features/` (3 files)
- `ERROR_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md` → `docs/features/error-recovery/GUIDE.md`
- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_BOOKING_DESIGN.md` → `docs/features/google-calendar-booking/DESIGN.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/features/error-recovery/IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### Archive to `docs/.archived/` (3 files)
- `TEST_FAILURE_REPORT.md` - Dated Oct 27
- `TEST_FAILURE_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md` - Debugging from Oct 27
- `TEST_RESULTS_AFTER_FIX.md` - Historical test results

## Result
**Root clutter reduced by ~60% (1,170 lines moved to features, 1,169 lines archived)**

## New Structure
```
my-app/
├── AGENTS.md                       (development guide)
├── README.md                       (setup)
├── DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md         (deployment)
├── CLAUDE.md & GEMINI.md           (IDE redirects)

└── docs/
    ├── features/

        ├── test-failure-report.md
        ├── test-failure-deep-analysis.md
        └── test-results-after-fix.md
```

## Key Benefits
- **Clear**: Engineers know where to find feature docs
- **Navigable**: README at each level guides exploration
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new features following same pattern
- **Clean**: Root level has only essential guides
- **Preserved**: Nothing lost, work notes archived for reference

## Implementation Time
- Phase 1 (Create dirs): 5 min
- Phase 2 (Move files): 10 min
- Phase 3 (Create READMEs): 10 min
- Phase 4 (Update refs): 5 min
- **Total**: ~30 minutes

## For Team
- **New engineers**: Start with AGENTS.md → README.md → docs/features/
- **Developers working on features**: Find guides in docs/features/[feature-name]/
- **Deployment**: Check DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md before deploying
- **Historical reference**: Archived notes available in docs/.archived/ if needed
