## TL;DR

Introduce an AI-powered voice demo assistant for trialists with 1–10 seats or personal email domains to help them reach first value faster — without Sales involvement.

The assistant will be accessible via Discovery page, Help menu, and sticky banner, leading to a web-based conversational experience that mimics a sales demo in a self-serve format.

The goal is to validate whether AI-driven, opt-in guidance can increase engagement and trial-to-paid conversion among users currently outside the sales-assisted funnel.

**Target cohorts:** Trialists with **1–10 CS** and/or **personal email domains** (freemail).

## Objective

Enable small/self-serve trialists to reach value faster through AI-driven assistance — offering instant, human-like guidance without adding Sales load or creating friction.

## Problem

* 1–10 CS and freemail users don’t have Sales-assist paths.  
* Outbound calls are costly and can feel spammy; inbox replies are slow.

The AI demo assistant offers a scalable, self-service alternative that mimics the helpfulness of a Sales conversation without the operational overhead.

## Solution

### Entry points 

To ensure discoverability and alignment with existing demo logic, we’ll reuse the same in-product surfaces as “Book a Demo” for 11+ users:

* **Discovery page card/task**: “Get instant help” CTA alongside the checklist  
* **Help menu** new “Talk to our AI Assistant” option for 1-10,   
* Sticky banner targeted to 1–10 CS users and freemail domains

The entry will lead to a web-based AI voice agent experience [https://pd-demo-playground.com/](https://pd-demo-playground.com/)  instead of a phone number to minimize friction and ensure a safe, trackable flow.

Optionally, a phone number can be included in follow-up emails to test channel preference.

### Success Metrics
