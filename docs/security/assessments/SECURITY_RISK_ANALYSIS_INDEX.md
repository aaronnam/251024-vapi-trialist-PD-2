- Deploy with monitoring (Week 2)
- Operational support & on-call rotation

### Product Team
- Decide: When to announce GA?
- Set expectations: SLA, uptime commitment
- Market segmentation: Which customers can we take?

### Sales/RevOps
- Wait for Phase 2 before enterprise deals
- Beta customers: Only with risk acknowledgment
- Success plan: Recovery process for each account

### Finance
- Reserve 50% cost contingency
- Prepare for compliance audit
- Insurance: Cyber liability coverage

### Legal/Compliance
- Update ToS with liability limits
- Privacy policy review (GDPR/CCPA alignment)
- Data Processing Agreement for enterprise

---

## Decision Checkpoint

### Can We Deploy Now?

**NO** ‚ùå

**Why**:
- 5 critical vulnerabilities identified
- Rate limiting blindness = guaranteed outage at scale
- Data security gaps = compliance risk
- No disaster recovery = data loss risk
- No monitoring = blind to problems

**What Must Happen First**:
1. API rate limit monitoring in place
2. Cost ceiling controls working
3. Secrets audit & remediation complete
4. Hardcoded secrets moved to env vars
5. Basic circuit breakers implemented
6. Disaster recovery plan documented

**Timeline**: 3-5 days, 1-2 engineers

**Then**: Beta with controlled users for 2 weeks
**Then**: Phase 2 operational hardening (2-3 weeks)
**Then**: Production GA (Week 4+)

## Questions & Clarifications

### "How urgent is this?"
**URGENT**: If we deploy now without fixes, production incident is nearly certain within 4 weeks.

### "What's the biggest risk?"
**Rate limiting + cost explosion**: Without monitoring, hitting API quotas will completely break the agent while costs spiral.

### "What's the biggest compliance risk?"
**GDPR/CCPA**: Unencrypted PII in Snowflake exposes company to $50K-500K+ in fines per incident.

### "Can we skip some mitigations?"
**No**. The 5 critical fixes are dependencies for everything else. Implementing advanced features without basics is like building 100th floor before foundation.

### "What if we just launch it anyway?"
**Likely outcome**:
- Week 1: Works fine, no issues
- Week 2: First rate limit incident, 30-min outage
- Week 3: Cost spike to $15K, customer complaints
- Week 4: Compliance inquiry about PII storage
- Week 5: Major customer asks for SOC 2, we can't comply
- Month 2: Incident investigation reveals secrets in git history
- Month 3: Data breach occurs
