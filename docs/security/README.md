## Detailed Assessments

See [./assessments/](./assessments/) for comprehensive analysis:

### [assessments/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](./assessments/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
High-level overview of risk landscape and financial impact.

**Risk Breakdown:**
- ðŸ”´ CRITICAL RISKS (5) - Can cause total service failure
- ðŸŸ  HIGH RISKS (5) - Degraded functionality or data loss
- ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISKS (4) - Operational impact

### [assessments/COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md](./assessments/COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md)
Detailed analysis of all identified risks with:
- Detailed risk descriptions
- Impact assessment
- Mitigation strategies
- Implementation effort estimates

### [assessments/INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md](./assessments/INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md)
Security and infrastructure-specific analysis covering:
- API security and rate limiting
- Data security and encryption
- Infrastructure resilience
- Cost management

---

## Risk Categories

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risks (Action Required)
1. **Rate Limiting Blindness** - No monitoring of API quotas
2. **Cost Explosion** - Up to 3-5x cost multiplier under load
3. **Service Dependencies** - 8 unmonitored external services
4. **Data Security** - PII stored unencrypted in Snowflake
5. **Single Region** - Complete outage if AWS us-east-1 fails

### ðŸŸ  High Risks (Near-Term Priority)
1. **Prompt Injection** - LLM vulnerabilities
2. **Secret Exposure** - 14+ API keys scattered
3. **WebRTC Failures** - 2-5% of calls affected
4. **Disaster Recovery** - No backup/restore procedures
5. **Analytics Gaps** - No observability into failures

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risks (Important for Stability)
1. **Performance Under Load** - Latency degradation
2. **Quota Scaling** - APIs not sized for growth
3. **Database Connections** - Connection pooling gaps
4. **Signal Detection** - Qualification bypass vulnerabilities

---

## Financial Impact

### Current Baseline
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$7,200 (300 calls Ã— $24/call)
- **Revenue at Risk**: ~$25,000/month (10 qualified leads Ã— $2,500 MRR)

### Risk Scenarios
- **Complete outage**: 100% revenue loss during incident
- **Rate limit exhaustion**: Unable to take calls for duration
- **Cost spike**: 3-5x increase possible under attack/load spike
- **Data breach**: Customer data exposure and compliance violations

---

## Mitigation Priority Framework

### Tier 1: Do First (Week 1)
These are non-negotiable for any production deployment:
- [ ] Add rate limit monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement secret rotation and secure storage
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch cost alarms
- [ ] Enable encryption for sensitive data at rest

### Tier 2: Do Soon (Week 2-3)
Essential for operational stability:
- [ ] Add distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry/LangFuse)
- [ ] Implement API circuit breakers
- [ ] Create disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Set up multi-region failover

### Tier 3: Do Next (Month 2)
Important for performance and scaling:
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add load testing
- [ ] Create performance baselines
- [ ] Plan infrastructure scaling

---

## Observability & Monitoring

These are implemented in [../observability/](../observability/):
- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- Real-time metrics collection
- CloudWatch enhanced queries
- Cost tracking and alerting

**See**: [../observability/OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md](../observability/OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md)

---

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR compliance (if EU customers)
- Data retention policies
- Encryption standards
- PII handling procedures
- Audit logging
