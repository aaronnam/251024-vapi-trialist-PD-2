# Observability Strategy

This directory contains the observability and monitoring strategy for the PandaDoc Voice Agent in production.

**Philosophy**: Tracing-first approach for production debugging. When users report issues, detailed traces show exactly what happened.

---

## Core Documentation

### [OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md](./OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md)
**Comprehensive observability architecture and design**

Complete strategy including:
- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing setup
- Real-time metrics collection from LiveKit
- Enhanced CloudWatch query patterns
- Cost tracking and monitoring
- Official Langfuse + LiveKit integration patterns

**Use when:** Understanding the full observability system or planning additions.

---

### [QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
**Step-by-step implementation guide**

Actionable instructions for:
- Setting up OpenTelemetry tracing
- Configuring Langfuse integration
- Creating CloudWatch dashboards
- Implementing custom metrics
- Testing the tracing pipeline

**Use when:** Implementing observability features in the agent.

## Key Components

### Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry + Langfuse)
- **Purpose**: Understand execution flow and performance bottlenecks
- **Tools**: OpenTelemetry SDK + Langfuse backend
- **Coverage**: Every API call, LLM invocation, and agent decision
- **Status**: Required for production

### Real-Time Metrics
- **Purpose**: Monitor health and detect anomalies
- **Tools**: LiveKit metrics events â†’ CloudWatch
- **Metrics**: Call duration, success rates, latency, costs
- **Status**: Partial (needs completion)

### Log Aggregation & Querying
- **Purpose**: Investigate failures and debug issues
- **Tools**: CloudWatch Logs with custom queries
- **Logs**: Agent decisions, API responses, errors
- **Status**: Good foundation, needs enhanced queries

### Cost Tracking
- **Purpose**: Monitor and control operational expenses
- **Tools**: UsageCollector + CloudWatch metrics
- **Metrics**: Cost per call, total monthly spend, cost anomalies
- **Status**: Implemented

## What You Get

### Debugging Production Issues
When a user reports "the agent was slow":
1. Find trace by user session ID
2. View timeline of all API calls and their durations
3. See LLM response time, TTS delay, STT timing
4. Identify exact bottleneck
5. Correlate with CloudWatch metrics

### Performance Baseline
- Know typical latency for each component
- Detect anomalies automatically
- Identify degradation trends
- Plan capacity improvements

### Cost Visibility
- Know exact cost per call
- Track cost anomalies
- Correlate with quality metrics
- Optimize expensive operations

### Reliability Tracking
- Success rate trends
- Error categorization
- Failure hotspots
- SLA compliance

## Getting Started

### For New Setup
1. Read [OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md](./OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md) (10 min)
2. Follow [QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md) (1-2 hours)
3. Verify tracing in Langfuse dashboard
4. Test with a real agent call

### For Existing System
1. Review [OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md](./OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md) changes
2. Check [QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for new components
3. Update existing traces if needed
4. Enhance dashboards

### For Debugging Issues
1. Use session ID to find trace in Langfuse
2. Review step-by-step execution timeline
3. Check CloudWatch metrics for anomalies
4. Cross-reference logs for context
