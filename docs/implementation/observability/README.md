## What You Have Now

### 1. **Real-Time Dashboard** üìä
CloudWatch dashboard with 6 widgets monitoring:
- P95 Latency (response times)
- Error Rate (failures)
- Latency Breakdown (component analysis)
- Qualified Leads (high-value calls)
- Recent Errors (with session IDs)
- Slow Sessions (with detailed metrics)

**Access**: [Open Dashboard](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-1#dashboards:name=pd-voice-agent-performance)

### 2. **Distributed Tracing** üîç
OpenTelemetry + Langfuse integration for complete request visibility
- Full timeline of each call
- Component timings (STT, LLM, TTS, Tools)
- Error details with stack traces
- Session-level filtering

**Access**: [Langfuse](https://us.cloud.langfuse.com)

### 3. **Automated Alerts** üö®
Three CloudWatch alarms monitoring critical metrics:
- `VoiceAgent-HighLatency` - Fires when P95 > 2 seconds
- `VoiceAgent-HighErrorRate` - Fires when error rate spikes
- `VoiceAgent-NoMetrics` - Fires when agent appears down

**Notifications**: SNS topic `voice-agent-alerts`

### 4. **Saved CloudWatch Queries** üíæ
8 pre-built queries for common investigations:
1. Voice Agent - P95 Latency (percentile analysis)
2. Voice Agent - Error Rate (breakdown by minute)
3. Voice Agent - Latency Breakdown (component timing)
4. Voice Agent - Qualified Leads (high-value sessions)
5. Voice Agent - Recent Errors (failures with details)
6. Voice Agent - Slow Sessions (>2s latency analysis)
7. Voice Agent - Tool Success Rate (reliability tracking)
8. Voice Agent - Token Usage (cost monitoring)

## Getting Started (Choose Your Path)

### **Path A: I Just Got an Alert** ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚Üí See `QUICK_START_DEBUGGING.md` (30 seconds)

### **Path B: I Want to Understand What Failed** üîé
‚Üí See `DEBUGGING_FAILED_CALLS.md` (comprehensive guide)

### **Path C: I Want to Use the Dashboard** üìà
‚Üí See `DASHBOARD_TO_LANGFUSE_WORKFLOW.md` (step-by-step)

### **Path D: I Need the Full Implementation Details** üõ†Ô∏è
‚Üí See `PERFORMANCE_DASHBOARD_SPEC.md` (AWS CLI commands)

## The Fast Path: Dashboard ‚Üí Langfuse

```
1. Open dashboard (link above)
2. Look at "Recent Errors" or "Slow Sessions" widget
3. Find the session_id you want to debug
4. Copy it
5. Go to Langfuse and paste
6. Read the trace timeline
7. Find the first ‚ùå (that's your problem)
8. Check DEBUGGING_FAILED_CALLS.md for how to fix it

Total time: 1-2 minutes
```
