## üîß Integration Points

Your LiveKit agent code integrates with Langfuse through:

**Telemetry Setup:**
- File: `/my-app/src/utils/telemetry.py`
- Function: `setup_observability(metadata={...})`
- Handles: OpenTelemetry configuration and LangFuse connection

**Agent Code:**
- File: `/my-app/src/agent.py`
- Location: Entrypoint and turn handlers
- Adds: session_id, user_id, tags, metadata to traces

**Key Configuration:**
```python
# In your agent
trace_provider = setup_observability(
    metadata={
        "langfuse.session.id": room_name,
        "langfuse.user.id": user_id,
        "environment": "production",
        "agent_version": "1.0.0"
    }
)

# During execution
langfuse_context.update_current_trace(
    tags=["qualified", "consent-given"],
    metadata={"qualification_score": 8.5}
)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Can't find recent traces
**Solution:** 15-30s ingestion delay
- File: LANGFUSE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md ‚Üí "Langfuse Limits & Gotchas"
- Or: LANGFUSE_SEARCH_FILTERING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí "Troubleshooting"

### Problem: Metadata filtering isn't working
**Solution:** Check metadata was set early in trace
- File: LANGFUSE_SEARCH_FILTERING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí "Troubleshooting Common Search Issues"

### Problem: Can't filter by tags
**Solution:** Avoid special characters in tags
- File: LANGFUSE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md ‚Üí "Langfuse Limits & Gotchas"
- Or: LANGFUSE_SEARCH_FILTERING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí "Troubleshooting"

### Problem: User traces not grouping
**Solution:** Set user_id and session_id together
- File: LANGFUSE_USER_ID_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md
- Or: LANGFUSE_SEARCH_FILTERING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí Section 2
