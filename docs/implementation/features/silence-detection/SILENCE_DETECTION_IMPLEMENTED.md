# Silence Detection & Rate Limiting - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## What Was Added

Simple, elegant silence detection and rate limiting has been added to your LiveKit voice agent to prevent "dead air" charges.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Silence Detection (30 seconds)**
```python
# Added to AgentSession (line 1143)
user_away_timeout=30,  # Marks user "away" after 30s of silence
```

**Behavior:**
- After 30s of silence, warns user: "Hello? Are you still there?"
- Gives 10 more seconds to respond
- If still silent, politely disconnects: "I'm disconnecting now due to inactivity"
- Tracks disconnect reason as "silence_timeout" in analytics

### 2. **Session Limits**
```python
# Configuration (lines 1150-1152)
max_session_minutes = 30  # 30-minute max
max_session_cost = 5.0    # $5 max per session
```

**Checks every 30 seconds for:**
- Session duration > 30 minutes → disconnects with "time_limit" reason
- Session cost > $5 → disconnects with "cost_limit" reason

### 3. **Event Handlers Added**

#### User State Handler (lines 1214-1239)
- Detects when user goes "away" (30s silence)
- Warns user and waits 10s
- Disconnects if still silent
- Resets when user speaks again

#### Session Limit Checker (lines 1242-1272)
- Runs every 30 seconds
- Checks time and cost limits
- Gracefully disconnects with appropriate message
- Properly cancels on session close

### 4. **Analytics Integration**
- Tracks disconnect reason: "silence_timeout", "time_limit", "cost_limit", or "user_initiated"
- Logs total cost and duration for every session
- Exports disconnect reason with session data

## Cost Savings

### Before Implementation:
- Risk: Accidental 2-hour call = ~$50
- Problem: User leaves phone connected, dead air keeps charging

### After Implementation:
- **Maximum session duration**: 30 minutes
- **Maximum session cost**: $5
- **Dead air protection**: Auto-disconnect after 30s silence
- **Estimated savings**: 90% reduction in worst-case scenarios

## Testing the Implementation

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Run in console mode
uv run python src/agent.py console

# Test scenarios:
1. Stay silent for 30s → Should warn then disconnect
2. Talk for 30+ minutes → Should hit time limit
3. Say something after warning → Should reset and continue
```

### Production Status:
- **Deployed**: Version v20251029181009
- **Status**: Running in LiveKit Cloud
- **Region**: us-east

## Configuration Options

You can adjust these values in `agent.py`:

```python
# Line 1143 - Silence timeout (seconds)
user_away_timeout=30,  # Change to adjust silence threshold

# Line 1151 - Session time limit (minutes)
max_session_minutes = 30

# Line 1152 - Session cost limit (dollars)
max_session_cost = 5.0
```

## Why This Solution is Elegant

1. **Uses LiveKit Native Features**: Leverages built-in `user_away_timeout` and `user_state_changed` events
2. **Minimal Code**: ~60 lines added, no external dependencies
3. **User-Friendly**: Warns before disconnecting, polite messages
4. **Integrated**: Works with existing cost tracking and analytics
5. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust limits without refactoring
6. **No Over-Engineering**: Direct solution to the problem, no unnecessary abstractions

## Monitoring

Check for silence disconnections in logs:
```bash
lk agent logs | grep -E "silence|away|disconnect|limit"
```

Example log output:
```
Session exceeded 30 minute limit
Session exceeded $5.00 cost limit
User state changed: speaking -> away
Disconnecting due to inactivity
Session closed - Reason: silence_timeout
```

## Next Steps

The implementation is live and protecting against dead air charges. No further action needed unless you want to:
- Adjust timeout thresholds
- Change warning messages
- Modify cost/time limits

All changes can be made by editing the values mentioned above and redeploying.
