## Adding New Features

When implementing a new feature:

1. **Create a subdirectory** under `features/` with the feature name (lowercase, hyphens)
2. **Create IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** with step-by-step instructions
3. **Add any supporting files** for coordination, verification, or research
4. **Update this README** with feature description

Follow this template for consistency:
```
## [feature-name/](./feature-name/)
**Brief description**

Longer description of what the feature does.

**Files:**
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - How to implement
- Other supporting files

**Key Points:**
- Important implementation detail 1
- Important implementation detail 2

**Status**: Development/Testing/Complete
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan** - Understand requirements from [../](../)
2. **Guide** - Follow implementation guide (IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
3. **Code** - Write the feature code (see my-app/)
4. **Test** - Follow testing procedures in guide
5. **Verify** - Use verification procedures provided
6. **Archive** - Move completed notes to [../../.project-status/completed-tasks/](../../.project-status/completed-tasks/)
