# Research Documentation

This directory contains technical research and reference materials for implementing PandaDoc Voice Agent using LiveKit's Agents Framework.

## Overview

The research documentation is organized into two main sections:
1. **LiveKit Technical Research** - Deep dives into LiveKit's capabilities, APIs, and patterns
2. **Quick References** - Condensed guides for rapid development reference

This research informed the implementation plan and provides the technical foundation for development.

## Directory Structure

### [livekit/](./livekit/)
**Comprehensive LiveKit Technical Research**

In-depth analysis of LiveKit's Agents Framework, covering function tools, testing patterns, and voice pipeline configuration. Each document provides detailed API references, code examples, and best practices.

**What's inside:**
- Function tools implementation (34K comprehensive guide)
- Testing framework and patterns (30K complete reference)
- Voice pipeline configuration (27K STT/TTS/VAD guide)
- Testing research findings

**Start here if:** You need deep technical understanding of LiveKit capabilities or are implementing complex features.
